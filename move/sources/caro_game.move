// 1.	AI strategy varies based on difficulty:
// 	-	Easy: 70% chance of making a random nearby move, 30% chance of making the optimal move.
// 	-	Medium: 30% random move, 70% optimal move.
// 	-	Hard: 100% optimal move (no randomness).
// 2.	AI decision-making logic:
// 	-	First, the AI checks if it can win immediately.
// 	-	If not, it checks if the player is about to win and blocks that move.
// 	-	If neither applies, it calculates the best move using a scoring system based on position and patterns.
// 	-	If thereâ€™s no obvious move, it takes the center or any valid cell.
